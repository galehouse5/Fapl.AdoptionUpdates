# Friendship APL Adoption Updates

Daily automated email, sent to volunteers of Friendship APL (Elyria, OH), that lists adopted pets.

Uses PetPoint.com API to determine which pets were adopted, Petfinder.com API to look for corresponding photos, and Azure Functions for hosting (at virtually no cost). Has enough configuration flexibility for use by other animal shelters that manage pets through PetPoint.com and post pets for adoption on Petfinder.com.
