# Friendship APL Adoption Updates

Daily automated email that lists the pets that were adopted, sent to volunteers of Friendship APL (Elyria, OH).

Uses PetPoint API to determine which pets were adopted, Petfinder API to look for corresponding photos, and Azure Functions for hosting. Has enough configuration flexibility to be used by other animal shelters that use PetPoint and Petfinder. Under Microsoft's current (May, 2017) pricing for Azure Functions, the hosting cost is virtually zero.
