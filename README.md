# Friendship APL Adoption Updates

Daily automated email that lists the pets that were adopted, sent to volunteers of Friendship APL (Elyria, OH).

Uses PetPoint.com API to determine which pets were adopted, Petfinder.com API to look for corresponding photos, and Azure Functions for hosting (at virtually no cost). Has enough configuration flexibility to be used by any animal shelter that manages pets through PetPoint.com and posts pets for adoption on Petfinder.com.
